# `str[start, len] = rhs` builds its result from pieces -- a head slice, the
# replacement, a tail slice -- and each of those allocates. Written as one
# nested expression the piece C evaluates first sat in an unrooted temporary
# while the next one allocated, so a collection landing in that window freed it
# and the splice read it back: the result took its length from recycled memory,
# or faulted outright where the allocator had returned the span to the OS.
#
# One splice never showed it; it needs enough of them for a collection to fall
# in the window. Before the fix this buffer lost 704 bytes partway through the
# loop and the next splice raised IndexError, and under SPINEL_GC_STRESS=1 it
# went wrong within twenty iterations. The invariants are simply that a splice
# of equal length leaves the length alone and writes what it was given.
