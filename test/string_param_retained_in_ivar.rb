# A string handed to a method and RETAINED in an ivar that is mutated in place
# has to stay the caller's string. The byref machinery only covered a callee
# that mutates the PARAMETER itself; one that merely stores it and mutates it
# later, through the ivar, left the caller holding a value copy and the two
# drifted apart (#4363). Both directions matter: the callee's mutation must
# reach the caller's name, and the caller's must reach the ivar.
