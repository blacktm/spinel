# spin — projects and packages

`spin` is Spinel's project tool: it scaffolds a project, resolves
dependencies (spin packages), and drives the compiler so you never write a
Makefile or a `spinel -I ...` line by hand. If you know cargo or mix, you
know the shape. The design record lives in
[internals/spin.md](internals/spin.md); this page is how to use it.

`spin` ships beside the compiler: building the repo (`make`) produces
`bin/spin`, and `make install` installs it next to `spinel`.

## Starting an application

```sh
spin new myapp        # scaffold: spin.toml, bin/myapp.rb, test/, .gitignore
cd myapp
spin run              # compile bin/myapp.rb and run it
```

```
myapp/
  spin.toml            # the manifest (name, [dependencies])
  myapp.rb            # library code: require "myapp" resolves here
  myapp/              # subfeatures: require "myapp/util" -> myapp/util.rb
  bin/myapp.rb        # each bin/*.rb is an executable (a compile root)
  test/               # each test/*.rb is a test program
  build/              # disposable output (spin clean)
```

An application **is** a package: there is no separate project kind. Executables
live in `bin/` (one per file, `spin run <name>` when there are several).
Grow the app by putting shared code in `myapp.rb` / `myapp/*.rb` and
requiring it from `bin/`; more `bin/*.rb` files become more executables.
`spin init` writes a `spin.toml` into an existing directory instead of
scaffolding. When the CLI is ready for daily use, `spin install` builds it
and copies the executables to `~/.local/bin` (`$XDG_BIN_HOME` / `--prefix`
override; `--uninstall` removes them).

Everything in the package participates by extension, not by manifest lists:
`.rb` is source, `.rbs` is an optional type sidecar, `.c`/`.h` is carried
native code (below). `build/`, `vendor/`, `test/`, and `bin/` are the only
special directory names.

## Starting a library

```sh
spin new mylib --lib  # spin.toml with [package] name/version, mylib.rb, test/
cd mylib
```

A library is the same package shape minus `bin/`: there is nothing to `spin
build` or `spin run` — a library is *exercised through its tests*:

```sh
cat > mylib.rb <<'RUBY'
module Mylib
  def self.shout(s) = s.upcase + "!"
end
RUBY
cat > test/shout_test.rb <<'RUBY'
require "mylib"
puts Mylib.shout("hi")   # HI!
RUBY
spin test                # runs it (against CRuby when no snapshot yet)
spin test --regen        # freeze the output as the .expected snapshot
```

While developing an application against your library, wire it up as a
live path dependency — edits take effect on the next build, nothing is
pinned:

```sh
cd ../myapp
spin add mylib --path ../mylib
```

To share it, push the directory as a git repo (conventionally named
`spinel-mylib`; the gem *name* stays `mylib` because it is the `require`
string). Consumers then use it directly:

```sh
spin add mylib --git https://github.com/you/spinel-mylib
```

or, once it has releases, through [the index](#the-index). Publishing a
release is one command:

```sh
spin publish
```

It validates the release (committed and pushed, `[package] name`/`version`
present, the tree at the release commit carrying that same version, the
name not owned by another repo in the index), **runs `spin test` as a hard
gate**, then submits `packages/mylib.toml` with a `[[release]]` entry pinning
the full commit SHA: as a pull request to
[spin-index](https://github.com/matz/spin-index) when the `gh` CLI is
available, by printed instructions otherwise, or pushed directly with
`--direct` if you have index write access. From then on
`spin add mylib --version "~> 0.1"` works, and bumping `version` +
`spin publish` again is how you ship an update. Libraries do not commit a
`spin.lock`; version selection belongs to the consuming application.

## Dependencies

Declare dependencies in `spin.toml`; `spin` computes the compiler's `-I`
list from them. Three source forms:

```toml
[dependencies]
ansi  = { path = "../spinel-ansi" }              # local checkout
greet = { git = "https://github.com/x/spinel-greet" }  # git URL (+ ref = "...")
hello = "~> 1.1"                                 # index constraint (see below)
```

```sh
spin add ansi --path ../spinel-ansi   # edits spin.toml and relocks
spin add hello --version "~> 1.1"     # index form
spin remove ansi
spin list                             # resolved set: name, version, source
spin tree                             # nested view (--json on both)
```

Dependencies are transitive: each fetched package's own `[dependencies]` is
resolved too. Inside a project every `require` must resolve — an
unsatisfiable `require` is a compile error naming the missing package, and
stdlib features need their `require` just like CRuby (`spin` compiles with
the require gate on; see [require.md](require.md)).

### The index

A bare `name = "constraint"` dependency is looked up in the index — a git
repository (no server) mapping names to repos and releases:
<https://github.com/matz/spin-index>. Constraints are `"~> 1.2"`
(pessimistic), `">= 1.2.3"`, an exact version, or `"*"`.

Selection is MVS: `spin` picks the **lowest** release satisfying the
constraint, so a build without a lockfile is still deterministic;
`spin.lock` then pins the exact commit. `spin search [term]` lists index
entries. Set `SPIN_INDEX` to use another index (a `file://` URL works).

Index entries also carry **probe records** — which compiler build a release
passed or failed its tests under (`spin publish` records a pass for your
build automatically; `spinel --version` prints the build revision). When
you depend on a release with a recorded failure, resolution warns before
fetching — strongly when the failure was recorded against your exact
compiler build — but never blocks: your own build is the final answer.

### spin.lock

`spin lock` (and `spin add`/`remove`) writes `spin.lock`: one `[lock.<name>]`
entry per dependency with the resolved version and, for git/index sources,
the full commit SHA. Commit it for applications. Resolution *verifies*
against the lock rather than reselecting; if you change a constraint so the
pinned version no longer satisfies it, the build warns and reselects, and
the next `spin lock` rewrites the pin.

### Offline and vendoring

Fetched packages live in a shared cache (`$XDG_CACHE_HOME/spin/packages/`),
keyed by the commit SHA. `spin vendor` copies the resolved tree into
`vendor/packages/` for hermetic builds; with `SPIN_OFFLINE=1`, resolution uses
only the cache and `vendor/` — nothing touches the network.

## Tests

Each `test/*.rb` is one test program, compiled with the package's sources and
dependencies spliced in. Pass/fail is snapshot-based:

```sh
spin test                 # run all tests
spin test smoke_test.rb   # one test
spin test --regen         # refresh .expected snapshots from CRuby
```

A committed `test/<name>.rb.expected` is diffed against the run's stdout.
With no snapshot, the same file runs under `ruby` and the outputs are
diffed directly — the test doubles as a CRuby-parity check. A non-zero
exit or a diff fails, so plain assert-and-raise style works.

## Native C in a package

Drop `.c`/`.h` files anywhere in the package tree and bind them with the
[FFI declarations](FFI.md):

```ruby
# fast.rb
module Fast
  ffi_func :fast_quad, [:int], :int
end
```

```c
/* fast_ext.c */
#include <stdint.h>
intptr_t fast_quad(intptr_t x) { return x * 4; }
```

`spin` compiles each `.c` once into a shared cache keyed by
(package, version, toolchain) — set `CC` to choose the compiler — and links the
objects into every dependent build. External libraries use the existing
`ffi_lib` declaration and need no manifest entry.

### Excluding C from the build

`.rb` enters the build by being required; `.c` enters by being there. That is
what lets a package carry native code without listing it, and it is the wrong
default when a repository holds a C program of its own — a `main()` beside the
Ruby will collide with the generated one at link time. `exclude` names what is
not part of this build:

```toml
[package]
name = "myapp"
exclude = ["standalone_c_app.c", "c_lib*.c", "cbits"]
```

Globs are relative to the package root; naming a directory prunes all of it.
One kind of `.c` needs no entry: a file spinel itself emitted. `spinel app.rb
-c -o out.c` writes a translation unit that defines `main` and, through the
compiler's internal header, its own copy of the runtime, so compiling it as
carried C collides with the real program on both. spin recognises its own
output by the banner on the first line, leaves it out of the build, and says
which file it left out — that file may be sitting on top of a source of the
same name it overwrote, in which case the source is gone and needs restoring.

`exclude` covers native discovery only — `.rb` needs no entry, since nothing
compiles it unless something requires it, and an excluded `.h` is still on the
include path for the C that is compiled. An application scaffolded by
`spin new` has no `[package]` table; add one to use the field.

## Choosing an allocator

A program that runs for a second and exits spends no meaningful time in
`malloc`. A server does: it allocates for every request for as long as it is
up, and on that shape the allocator is a measurable fraction of the whole
profile. `allocator` names the one this program wants:

```toml
[package]
allocator = "jemalloc"
```

Anything `-l<name>` can link is accepted, and it becomes an ordinary link
input. `"system"` and the absent key both mean the platform's own allocator,
which is the default and stays the default: spinel compiles batch programs and
benchmarks as readily as servers, and the right allocator is a property of the
program rather than of the language. Only the manifest knows which kind of
program this is. An application scaffolded by `spin new` has no `[package]`
table; add one to use the field.

The field applies to the executables *this* package produces. A dependent
never compiles a dependency's `bin/`, so a dependency's `allocator` does not
reach your program: the one that applies is the one in the manifest you are
building. A process has a single allocator, and choosing it is not a decision
a library makes for everyone who depends on it.

The library has to be linkable at build time, which on Debian and Ubuntu means
the development package (`libjemalloc-dev`) and not just the runtime one
(`libjemalloc2`). Asking for an allocator that is not installed fails the
build:

```console
$ spin build
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -ljemalloc: No such file or directory
```

That is deliberate. The manifest states what the program needs, and an unmet
statement should fail the way an unresolvable dependency does — quietly
building something slower than what was asked for is how one machine's binary
comes to differ from another's without anyone noticing.

On two Rails-derived applications compiled by spinel, `"jemalloc"` was worth
+58% on one OS worker and +25% on twelve for a 420 KB page, and +22% and +59%
for a 6 KB one. It is the same reason Rails ships jemalloc in its production
image.

## Building outside spin

`spin build` owns the tree it sits in. When the build is driven from somewhere
else — a Makefile that also builds a C program, a repository whose layout is
not spin's to arrange — `spin flags` hands over instead of taking over. It
resolves the dependencies, compiles any carried C into the cache, and prints
the compiler flags that implies:

```console
$ spin flags
--require-gate -I /path/pkgs/curses -I /path/backend --link ~/.cache/spin/native/curses-0.1.0-cc/sp_curses.o
```

Every path is absolute, so the caller's working directory can be anywhere:

```make
SPINFLAGS := $(shell cd spin/backend && spin flags)

ruby_app.exe: ruby_app.rb $(RUBY_SRCS)
	spinel $(SPINFLAGS) -I . $< -o $@
```

What it prints is what `spin build` compiles with, minus the entry file and
`-o`; the two come from one place, so they cannot drift.

Nothing here is required to consume a package by hand. `require "curses"`
resolves against any `-I` root as `<root>/curses.rb` or
`<root>/curses/curses.rb`, so `spinel -I spin/packages` finds a package sitting
at `spin/packages/curses/`, and `--link` takes its compiled object. `spin
flags` is the part that works out which roots and which objects.

## Rebuilds

`spin build`/`run`/`test` skip recompilation when nothing changed (input
mtimes across the project, its dependencies, and the compiler binary).
There is no file-granular incremental mode — whole-program type
specialization spans every source — but compiles are fast and package C
objects are reused from the cache. `spin clean` removes `build/`.

## Command summary

| command | what it does |
|---|---|
| `spin new <name> [--lib]` / `spin init` | scaffold / adopt a directory |
| `spin build [target..]` | compile `bin/` executables into `build/bin/` |
| `spin run [target] [-- args]` | build, then run one executable |
| `spin test [file..] [--regen]` | run `test/*.rb` against snapshots |
| `spin add` / `remove` | edit `[dependencies]` and relock |
| `spin lock` / `fetch` / `vendor` | pin / warm the cache / copy into `vendor/` |
| `spin flags` | print the compiler flags this project implies, for a build driven from outside spin |
| `spin list` / `tree` / `search` (`--json`) | inspect the resolved set / the index |
| `spin publish [--direct]` | validate + test, then submit this release to the index |
| `spin install [name..]` | build and copy `bin/` executables to `~/.local/bin` (`--prefix`, `--uninstall`) |
| `spin clean` | remove `build/` |

Environment: `SPIN_INDEX` (index URL), `SPIN_OFFLINE=1` (cache/vendor
only), `CC` (toolchain for package C), `SPIN_NATIVE_CACHE` (where compiled
package objects go, default `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/spin/native`),
`SPIN_NO_NATIVE_CACHE=1` (recompile package C every time),
`SPINEL_HDR_DIR` (where the runtime headers are, when spin cannot work it out
from the compiler's own path).

### When the cache is in the way

Package `.c` files compile into a shared cache keyed by (package, version,
toolchain), so the same package is not rebuilt for every consumer. That is
worth having across projects and unhelpful while debugging one: a run behaves
differently depending on whether an object happens to be there already, which
is exactly what you do not want when you are trying to find out why a build
differs. `SPIN_NO_NATIVE_CACHE=1` makes every run start from the same state,
and `SPIN_NATIVE_CACHE=<dir>` puts the objects somewhere you can delete.

Note what it does and does not save. The objects are the cheap half: hand-
written C compiles in milliseconds, while whole-program type inference over
the Ruby is where the time goes. The cache exists so a package is not
recompiled once per consuming project, not to make a single build fast.

## Extensions: a Ruby kernel compiled into a CRuby native extension

`spin ext` turns a Ruby method into a C extension for stock CRuby: write the
hot function in Spinel's Ruby subset, keep your application on CRuby.

```
spin ext new fast_math     # scaffold an extension gem
cd fast_math               # edit lib/fast_math/kernel.rb
spin ext build             # emit the C, the shim and the header into ext/
spin ext test              # every case through BOTH paths, answers must match
gem build fast_math.gemspec
```

The kernel is **plain Ruby**: it runs under CRuby unchanged, which makes it
its own fallback (the generated loader `require`s the extension and falls
back to the source) and its own test oracle (`spin ext test` runs each case
through the pure kernel and the compiled one and diffs). The `if __FILE__ ==
$0` block at the bottom is the manual test driver *and* how the exported
methods get their types -- it never runs at extension load.

`spin.toml` names what crosses:

```toml
[ext]
module = "FastMath"
entries = ["FastMath.mandelbrot", "FastMath.render"]
```

Exported methods take and return `Integer`, `Float`, `bool`, `String`, and
typed arrays of these; values cross **by copy**, so mutating a parameter is
refused at compile time (return the result instead). A kernel `raise`
crosses as the same exception class and message. Kernels run **without the
GVL** -- other Ruby threads keep running -- one call at a time.

The built gem ships the generated C and vendors the runtime sources:
installing it needs only a C compiler, never Spinel. `rake-compiler` and
plain `gem install` work as for any hand-written extension.

Layer underneath (any host, not just CRuby): `spinel kernel.rb -c
--ext-init NAME --ext-entry Mod.m,...` emits a library with a host-callable
init function and an `.h` contract that states each entry's C signature;
`spinel --help` lists the flags. `spin ext build` drives exactly this, so
the emitted `ext/<name>/<name>.h` of any scaffolded gem is a worked example
of the contract.
