# tsan-run.sh -- compile and run a threaded spinel program under ThreadSanitizer.
#
# The normal test gate links the single-threaded archive even for threaded tests
# (test-run does its own cc with libspinel_rt.a and no -DSP_THREADS), so it never
# exercises the mt archive's parallel paths. This drives a program through the
# *threaded* runtime instead, instrumented with TSan, so a data race on the
# shared GC heap, the thread registry, or the run queue is reported instead of
# silently corrupting memory. This is the Phase 1 (N>1) validation gate.
#
# Usage: scripts/tsan-run.sh prog.rb [prog args...]
#   SPINEL=path/to/spinel  to override the compiler binary
#   SPINEL_WORKERS=N       to set the worker count (once N>1 lands)
set -euo pipefail

# --spin DIR drives a whole spin APPLICATION through this, not just a lone .rb:
# `spin flags` in DIR prints exactly the flags `spin build` would pass (the
# package include paths, the require gate, and the native objects it has
# already compiled), so the program under TSan is the one the application
# really builds. The --link operands are for the LINK line, not for `-S`, so
# they are split back out below.
#
#   scripts/tsan-run.sh --spin path/to/app path/to/app/bin/app.rb
#
# A race inside a C library the application binds (SQLite, say) is reported
# against the thread that entered it, which is what makes this worth having:
# the runtime's own parallelism and the library's meet in one report.
